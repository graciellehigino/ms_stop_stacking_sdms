\caption{The ``BAM diagram,'' adapted from (Jorge Sober√≥n 2007). Open
circles are absences and solid circles are observed presences. Big
circles correspond to the theoretical space of a species, regarding its
biotic interactions (the B), the abiotically suitable space (the A) and
the geographic area accessible to it (the M). These three aspects
represent real points of occurrence on the real geographic space (the
G). Ecological interactions act over this model in four ways: in (1),
there are potential interactions that are never realized because of
geographical and environmental constraints; in (2) interactions are
realized on accessible, abiotically suitable areas; the space (3) is
where the species could eventually go and establish new interactions,
while (4) is the area where the occurrence of the species is limited
only by abiotic factors.}\label{fig:bam}

\caption{In the proposed workflow, probabilities of occurrence would be
updated by the probabilities of new interactions where the Habitat
Suitability Model suggests potential occurrence. For the sample sites
where a species is predicted to occur, but did not occur before, the
probability of this species to belong to a network where it has at least
one link would be calculated based on the species richness of those
cells. For the cells where the probability of having at least one link
is higher than 0 (or a given threshold, depending on the system), the
probability of interaction with important clades would then be assessed,
and finally this probability updates the probability of
occurrence.}\label{fig:synthesis}
